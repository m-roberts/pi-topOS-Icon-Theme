Implement Papirus icon theme, with custom modifications

## NOTE
This theme inherits from other themes, in the following order:
* Papirus-Dark
* Papirus
* breeze-dark
* PiX
* gnome
* hicolor

When searching for an icon to override, it is recommended to check PiX first, as this is a good guide for how to override the UI in Raspbian.
